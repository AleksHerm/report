## Why?

Many metrics used in statistics (indices of fit, model performance or parameter estimates) can be very abstract. A long experience is required to intuitively "*feel*" the meaning of their values. In order to facilitate the understanding of the results they are facing, many scientists use (often implicitly) some set of *rules of thumb*. In order to validate and standardize such interpretation grid, some authors validated and published them in the form of guidelines. One of the most famous interpertation grid was proposed by **Cohen (1988)** for a series of widely used indices, such as the correlation **r** (*r* = .20, small; *r* = .40, moderate and *r* = .60, large) or the **standardized difference** (*Cohen's d*). 

Readers should keep in mind that these thresholds are arbitrary and should be discussed on a case-by-case basis, to avoid their crystalisation, as for the infamous ***p* < .05** example. 

`report` implements such sets of rules of thumb for a variety of indices in a flexible and explicit fashion.

## Supported Indices

### Correlation *r*

##### **Cohen (1988)**

`interpret_r(x, rules = "cohen1988")`

- **r = 0 - 0.1**: Very small
- **r = 0.1 - 0.3**: Small
- **r = 0.3 - 0.5**: Moderate
- **r > 0.5**: Large


### Correlation *d*

TODO.
