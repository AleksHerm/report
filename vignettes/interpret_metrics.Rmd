## Why?

The metrics used in statistics (indices of fit, model performance or parameter estimates) can be very abstract. A long experience is required to intuitively "***feel***" the meaning of their values. In order to facilitate the understanding of the results they are facing, many scientists use (often implicitly) some set of **rules of thumb**. Thus, in order to validate and standardize such interpretation grids, some authors validated and published them in the form of guidelines. One of the most famous interpertation grid was proposed by **Cohen (1988)** for a series of widely used indices, such as the correlation **r** (*r* = .20, small; *r* = .40, moderate and *r* = .60, large) or the **standardized difference** (*Cohen's d*). 

The package **`report`** implements such sets of rules of thumb for a variety of indices in a flexible and explicit fashion, helping you understanding and reporting your results in a scientific yet meaningful way. However, readers should keep in mind that these thresholds, altough "*validated*", **remain arbitrary**. Thus, their use should be discussed on a case-by-case basis depending on the field, hypotheses, prior results and so on, to avoid their crystalisation, as for the infamous ***p* < .05** example.



## Supported Indices

### Coefficient of determination  (R2)


##### @falk1992primer

```r
interpret_r2(x, rules = "falk1992")
```

- **R2 < 0.1**: Negligible
- **R2 > 0.1**: Adequate



##### @cohen1988statistical

```r
interpret_r2(x, rules = "cohen1988")
```

- **R2 = 0 - 0.02**: Very weak
- **R2 = 0.02 - 0.16**: Weak
- **R2 = 0.16 - 0.26**: Moderate
- **R2 > 0.26**: Substantial




##### @chin1998partial

```r
interpret_r2(x, rules = "chin1998")
```

- **R2 = 0 - 0.19**: Very weak
- **R2 = 0.19 - 0.33**: Weak
- **R2 = 0.33 - 0.67**: Moderate
- **R2 > 0.67**: Substantial

##### @hair2011pls

```r
interpret_r2(x, rules = "hair2011")
```

- **R2 = 0 - 0.25**: Very weak
- **R2 = 0.25 - 0.50**: Weak
- **R2 = 0.50 - 0.75**: Moderate
- **R2 > 0.75**: Substantial



### Correlation *r*

##### @cohen1988statistical

```r
interpret_r(x, rules = "cohen1988")
```

- **r = 0 - 0.1**: Very small
- **r = 0.1 - 0.3**: Small
- **r = 0.3 - 0.5**: Moderate
- **r > 0.5**: Large


### Standardized Difference *d* (Cohen's *d*)

The sandardized difference can be obtained through the standardization of linear model's parameters or data, in which they can be used as indices of effect size.


##### @cohen1988statistical

```r
interpret_d(x, rules = "cohen1988")
```

- **d = 0 - 0.2**: Very small
- **d = 0.2 - 0.5**: Small
- **d = 0.5 - 0.8**: Medium
- **d > 0.8**: Large

##### @sawilowsky2009new

```r
interpret_d(x, rules = "sawilowsky2009")
```

- **d = 0 - 0.1**: Tiny
- **d = 0.1 - 0.2**: Very small
- **d = 0.2 - 0.5**: Small
- **d = 0.5 - 0.8**: Medium
- **d = 0.8 - 1.2**: Large
- **d = 1.2 - 2**: Very large
- **d > 2**: Huge


### Odds ratio

Odds ratio, and *log* odds ratio, are often found in epidemiological studies. However, they are also the parameters of ***logistic*** regressions, where they can be used as indices of effect size.

##### @chen2010big

```r
interpret_odds(x, rules = "chen2010")
```

- **d = 0 - 1.68**: Very small
- **d = 1.68 - 3.47**: Small
- **d = 3.47 - 6.71**: Medium
- **d > 6.71**: Large

##### @cohen1988statistical

```r
interpret_odds(x, rules = "cohen1988")
```

This converts odds ratio to standardized difference *d* using the following formula [@cohen1988statistical;@sanchez2003effect]:

```r
d <- odds * (sqrt(3) / pi)
```

### Bayesian Indices (\% in ROPE, p*d*)

The interpretation of Bayesian indices is detailed in [this article](https://easystats.github.io/bayestestR/articles/4_Guidelines.html).
