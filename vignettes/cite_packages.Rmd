**Citing the packages, modules and softwares you used for your analysis is important**, both from a **reproducibility perspective** (statistical routines are often implemented in different ways by different packages, which could explain possible discrepancies in the results. Saying *"I did this using this function from that package version 1.2.3"* is a way of protecting yourself by being transparent about what you have found doing what you have done), but also for **acknowledging** the work and time that people spent creating tools for others (sometimes at the expense of their own research).

- **That's great, but how to *actually* cite them?**
- **I used about 100 packages, should I cite them *all*?**

## What should I cite?

Ideally, you should indeed cite all the packages that you used. However, it's often not possible to cite them all in the manuscript body. Therefore, I would recommend the following:

### **1. Cite the main/important packages in the manuscript**

This should be done for the packages that were central to your specific study (*i.e.,* that got you the results that you reported) rather than data manipulation tools (*even though these are as much important*).

##### Example:

> Statistics were done using R 3.5.0 (R Core Team, 2018), the *rstanarm* (*v2.13.1*; Gabry & Goodrich, 2016) and the *report* (*v0.1.0*; Makowski, 2019) packages. The full reproducible code is available in **Supplementary Materials**.

### **2. Present everything in Supplementary Materials**

Then, in *Supplementary Materials*, you can show all the packages and functions you used. To do it quickly, explicitly and in a reproducible fashion, I cannot recommend more writing the *Supplementary Materials* with [**R Markdown**](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), which can generate *docs* and *pdf* files that you can submit along with your manuscript. Moreover, if you're using R, you can include (usually at the end) every used package citation and their version using the `cite_packages()` function from the [**report**](https://github.com/neuropsychology/report) package.

##### Example:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(report)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

cite_packages(sessionInfo())
```
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(report)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

knitr::kable(cite_packages(sessionInfo()))
```


## How should I cite it?

Finding the right citation information is sometimes complicated. In R, this process is made quite easy, you simply run `citation("packagename")`. For instance, `citation("dplyr")`:

    To cite ‘dplyr’ in publications use:

      Hadley Wickham, Romain François, Lionel Henry and Kirill Müller (2018). dplyr: A Grammar of Data Manipulation. R package version
      0.7.6. https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr

    A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is

      @Manual{,
        title = {dplyr: A Grammar of Data Manipulation},
        author = {Hadley Wickham and Romain François and Lionel Henry and Kirill Müller},
        year = {2018},
        note = {R package version 0.7.6},
        url = {https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr},
      }

For other languages, such as Python or Julia, it might be a little trickier, but a **quick search on google (*or github*)** should provide you with all the necessary information (version, authors and date). **Finally, keep in mind that it's better to have a slightly incomplete citation than no citation at all.**
