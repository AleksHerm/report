``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("neuropsychology/report")
```

``` r
library("report")
```

Goal
====

***"From R to Manuscript"***

`Psycho`'s primary goal is to fill the gap between Julia's output and the formatted result description of your manuscript, with the automated use of **best practices** guidelines, ensuring standardization and quality of results reporting. It also provides useful tools and functions for psychologists, neuropsychologists and neuroscientists for their everyday data analyses.

Contribute
==========
